# Real-model performance

These are retained native Windows results for Qwen3.6-35B-A3B BF16 on Ryzen AI
Max+ 395 (`gfx1151`), batch size 1. Startup is measured separately from TTFT.
Every retained product row was accepted only with its matching external BF16
correctness boundary.

The last historical prefix row used a 263,680-token qualification service
limit. The public HTTP profile defaults to a stricter 262,144-token total
context; operators must not infer that the larger row changes the released
default contract.

## q8192 retained target

The confirmed retained target is 1,506.407 prefill tok/s and 4,187.416 ms TTFT.
The accepted row reached 2,126.186 tok/s and 3,852.909 ms. Model plus engine
load remained below the 30-second product bound.

## Correctness attachment

At q8192 the external BF16 authority and native runtime selected token 16. The
authority first-token logit was 24.750 and native was 24.875, an absolute
difference of 0.125 (the declared tolerance boundary).

Long continuation checks generated 512/512 matching tokens:

| Case | Input digest | Output digest | Match |
|---|---|---|---:|
| cold q131072 | `ffef18d340fb4fe8` | `4813300b562d057b` | 512 / 512 |
| prefix q131072 + 1024 | `9a681295dde809d4` | `fd69ca7327c912bf` | 512 / 512 |
| prefix q262144 + 1024 | `6aa7d9579bb8427c` | `7a8c5d8ec398878b` | 512 / 512 |

Digests are compact publication identifiers, not standalone correctness
authority. Acceptance was token-for-token against the external BF16 service.

## Interpretation

TTFT excludes model/engine startup but includes real prompt prefill and the
first generated token. Prefix throughput divides the full effective prompt by
the measured reused-prefix request time and should not be compared as cold
compute throughput. Results are specific to the stated model, hardware,
toolchain, runtime profile, and batch size.
